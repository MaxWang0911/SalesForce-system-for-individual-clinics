## 🔧 Project Problem

Clinic A is one of several small clinics operated by a large group. It offers basic GP consultation, referral, and treatment services, but lacks standalone finance and HR departments.

The clinic needed a lightweight, integrated solution to:
- Manage patient registration and appointment booking
- Streamline diagnosis and referral workflows
- Automate invoice creation and apply patient discounts
- Assign role-specific access for Admin, Doctor, Duty Manager, and Group Manager
- Support workflow automation, validation, and approval without writing custom code

## 📊 System Analysis & Data Modeling

- **Dataflow Mapped**: From patient entry to appointment, diagnosis, and billing
- **Entity Design**: Patient, Appointment, Diagnosis, Referral, Invoice, DiscountApproval
- **Relationships**:
  - `Lookup Relationship`: Patient ↔ Appointment
  - `Master-Detail`: Appointment ↔ Diagnosis, Invoice ↔ Discount Approval
- **Validation Rules**: Enforce data quality for fields like Medicare number, DOB, appointment time, and invoice amount
